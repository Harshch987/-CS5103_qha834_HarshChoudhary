Program to count the frequency of each unique word.

First Requirement Change:-
Addition of two feature to count the number of lines and characters with 3 unit tests.
(supports combinations of space, tab, and newline characters as separators).

TEST CASE 1 -

1.Enter a string or text into the python program.  
2.The program returns the count of each character and count of lines present in the string.  
3.It should be able to read across spaces, tabs, and newline character as seperators.

       World 
       Python Program

Output: Lines: 3, Characters: 23

2.The program checks whether the input text is empty string and returns ouput accordingly.  

Input: 

Output: Lines: 0, Characters: 0

TEST CASE 3 -

1.Enter a string or text into the python program.  
2.The program removes all the special characters present in the input string.  
3.It should be able to read across spaces, tabs, and newline character as seperators.  
 
Input: Hello, world!

Output: Hello world

#How to run program On Terminal 
-------------------------------------------

Install Python3 before starting.
Change directory to where 'index.py' is located. 
Enter 'python3 index.py' on terminal to run python file.
The program will execute and will print the output accordingly to the text taken as input. 
It prints the the count of unique words, number of lines and number of characters.

Followed by unit test which performs operations of string as :
1. Word replacement.
2. Count lowercase characters.
3. Convert all uppercase character to lowercase.
4. Returns the count of each character and lines(new).
5. Checks for input text is empty string(new).
6. Removes all the special characters(new).
